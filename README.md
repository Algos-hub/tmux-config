# Tmux Config File

This is my personal Tmux configuration file

The following plugins have been used:

Plugin Manager: ['tmux-plugins/tpm'](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm)\
Standard base options: ['tmux-plugins/tmux-sensible'](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-sensible)\
Copy and paste: ['tmux-plugins/tmux-yank'](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-yank)\
Status line: ['o0th/tmux-nova'](https://github.com/o0th/tmux-nova)\

# Installation

To install, clone this repo and move the .tmux.conf file into your home directory.

```
    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/Algos-hub/tmux-config
    mv ./tmux-config/.tmux.conf ~
```
Once that's done, open tmux and press `Prefix` + `I` (on a fresh intallation of tmux it should be `C-b`)
